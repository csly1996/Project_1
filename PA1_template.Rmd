This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load the data 
setwd("C:/Users/apple/Desktop")

# mean & median
mean(steps_per_day$steps)

# Mean of total number of steps per day is 10766.19, median is 10765.

# Calculate average steps per interval for all days

avg_steps_per_interval [max_steps_row, ]
# The interval 835 has the maximum average value of steps (206.1698).


# Calculate the number of rows with missing values
sum(is.na(activity))

# Loop thru all the rows of activity
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
    if(is.na(activity$steps[i])) {
        val <- avg_steps_per_interval$steps[which(avg_steps_per_interval$interval == activity$interval[i])]
